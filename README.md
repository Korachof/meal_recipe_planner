# Meal Recipe Planner README

Welcome to the no-judgment meal planning, recipe storing app, Meal Recipe Planner!

This app is currently in development.

Once it is finished, it will allow users to manually input in recipes/dishes they enjoy and will randomly select those dishes to plan out a weekly meal schedule. 

Includes:
- Import recipes and dishes you enjoy! Add them to one of five included categories (Entree, Vegetable, Fruit, Dessert, Side), and add custom keywords.
- Use the automated Weekly Meal Planner to automatically generate the next week's meal schedule. Use a variety of options to add cheat meals/days, and which categories you would like included in each meal. (Only want a meal full of meat? You can!)
